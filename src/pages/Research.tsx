            heterogeneity jointly impact children’s test score gains. Findings
            reveal strong family influence and positive interactions in
            high-gain environments, benefiting lower-scoring children.

            This paper demonstrates that, rather than family disruption itself,
            relocation associated with such disruptions is the primary driver of
            the test score gap between children who experience changes in family
            composition and those who do not.
